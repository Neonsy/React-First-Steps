# Introduction To States

## Why use States?

Props are immutable, which means that the data cannot be changed.

But what if we want to change the data?

That's where states come in.

## What is a State?

State is an object which holds data related to a component.
The value of the state can be changed.

It can also control the behavior of the component.
For example, it can be used to control the rendering of the component.

## Props vs States

Props are usually passed to a component.
State is contained within the component.

Props are immutable.
State is mutable.

Props are like arguments, passed to a function.
State is like a variable, that is stored in the function.
