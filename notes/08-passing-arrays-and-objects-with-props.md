# Passing Arrays And Objects With Props

You can pass arrays, functions and objects as props to a component.

The approach is the same as passing any other type of prop.

Just keep in mind that if you were not to destructure the prop, you would need to access it using the `props` keyword, so for an object it is one layer deeper.
