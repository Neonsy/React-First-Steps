# Destructuring Props

Destructuring is a concept that does not belong to React, but to JavaScript.
It allows you to extract values from an object, and assign them to variables.

For example you can create a const variable, and use object destructuring to extract the values from the object.
Rather than that approach, you can do that by using the curly braces, and then specifying the variable names.
