# 2. Components are the building blocks of React

Components are the building blocks of React, and they're the most important part of the framework.
React is based component based architecture, and it's one of the reason why it's so popular.

A component can be small and nested in other components that comprise of those small components.

## Components (UI)

If we look at a search bar, which features an input field, and a button, we can say that the search bar is a component.
That search bar is a component, which is made up of two smaller components, the input field and the button.

## Components (Logic)

A component lives in a `jsx` file.
A **JSX** component is a function that returns JSX.

So it starts with the function keyword, as well as the name of the function, which should always be capitalized.
