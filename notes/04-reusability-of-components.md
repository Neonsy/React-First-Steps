# Reusability of Components

Breaking a web application down into multiple components is a great way to make it more maintainable.
That's also where the modularity of React comes in.

Components are also reusable, just like css classes are.

Another important aspect of components is testing.
Due to components being isolated from each other, it's easier to test them.

Abstraction is another important aspect of components.
If you have a complex component, it won't obscure overview of the application.
That's because the component is represented as an *element*.
