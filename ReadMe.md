This repository contains my learnings steps, as I venture into React.
Branches are named after the chapter they are for, and will contain the code for that chapter.
The `main` branch will contain the full code, added linearly from all the branches.

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is under active development, as I've currently set out to learn React.

> I'll be adding more content as I go along.

While I do want to learn ReactQuery, ReactRouter, NextJS and TypeScript, I'm not going to be using them in this repository.
I'll be solely using React, in correlation with Vite.

## Goal

As the project's name suggests, the steps taken here will be the first towards learning several technologies, that work brilliantly together.
I have varying experience, but I want to learn them properly.

My goal is to learn React, and to learn how to use it with Vite.

However, the following represents my full learning goal, that I'll pursue after completing this project:

- **[React](https://github.com/facebook/react)**
- **[Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)**
- [NextJS](https://github.com/vercel/next.js)
- [NextAuth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth)
- [ReactQuery](https://github.com/TanStack/query)
- [TRPC](https://github.com/trpc/trpc)
- [DrizzleORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)
- [TailwindCSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss)
- [ShadcnUI](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui)
